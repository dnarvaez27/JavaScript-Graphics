## Goal
This set of libraries was made, in first instance to learn, 
but I have enjoyed a lot making them. 
I already have used some of them in some projects and I have feel proud of it,
this also has make me realise some bugs that I have fixed (others I haven't).

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript ES6
* SVG.js
* Canvas

## Requirements
If you want to download the source code, realise there are some libraries attached to it.
The majority of them are from my author (Except from jQuery, SVG.js, SVG.dragable). 
No others requirements are necesary.

## Authors
