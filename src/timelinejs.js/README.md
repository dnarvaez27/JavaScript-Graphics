# TimeLine
This library creates a graphical timeline in a easy way, implementing an HTML Canvas.
> <small>**Important:** This library was made using Custom Elements, from Web Components, which is ONLY supported in Chrome, Opera and Safari. 
    Firefox is developing its support and Edge is considering.  
    For more information see: https://www.webcomponents.org/  
    _Soon I will be uploading an all browser compatible library_
